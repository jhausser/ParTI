function a=GoCategoriesLeaveOneOut(GOidx,GOcat2Genes,DataPoints,NArchetypes,algNum,numIter,EnMatCont,binSize)

%% Inputs
% GOidx - the index of all significant GO categories
% GOcat2Genes - A matrix storing for each GO category (column) the list of
% genes that are related to that GO category 
% DataPoints - Data points is the values of different traits (e.g. expression
% level of genes) - each sample is a row, each trait (gene) is a column
% NArchetypes - Number of archetypes to look for in the new projected data
% set
% algNum - states which archetype algorythem to use: 
%    algNum=1 :> Sisal (default)
%    algNum=2 :> MVSA
%    algNum=3 :> MVES
%    algNum=4 :> SDVMM
%    algNum=5 :> PCHA
% numIter - The number of iterations to run the algorithm for minimal
% bounding simplex
% EnMatCont - is a real matrix with each Continuous feature as a column, each row is a
%  datapoint (order of datapoints and their features should match).
% binSize - the bin size
% 
% Output
% a boolean vector indicating whether enrichment is still significant after
% leave-one-out (1) or not (0)
